# Arithmetic Project

## Overview
This is a simple Python project that performs basic arithmetic operations:
- Sum
- Difference
- Product
- Division

Each operation is implemented in a separate module, and the `main.py` file demonstrates how to use them.

## Files
- `main.py` – Runs the arithmetic project and prints results.
- `sum.py` – Contains the `add(a, b)` function.
- `difference.py` – Contains the `subtract(a, b)` function.
- `product.py` – Contains the `multiply(a, b)` function.
- `division.py` – Contains the `divide(a, b)` function.
